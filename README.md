# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

##  Project Overview
This project is a complete end-to-end analysis of an e-commerce dataset.  
Using SQL and Power BI, I explored customer behavior, marketing impact, sales trends, and cohort retention, rfm segmentation.  
It covers **8 levels** of progressively advanced business questions — from basic KPIs to RFM segmentation and cohort analysis — to provide actionable insights.

##  Problem Statement
Businesses often collect large amounts of transactional data but struggle to turn it into insights.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- Clean and model raw transactional data  
- Answer key business questions (sales, marketing, customer behavior)  
- Build dashboards that help decision-makers act faster  

##  Tools and Technology Used
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data cleaning, transformations, and answering business questions  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- **Excel** – Quick checks and initial exploration  


##  Workflow 
I divided the analysis into multiple levels to mirror real-world problem solving:
1. **Level 1–3:** Basic KPIs, coupons, discounts, and sales trends  
2. **Level 4–6:** Marketing spend analysis, RFM segmentation, and cross-sell patterns  
3. **Level 7–9:** Cohort analysis, retention matrix, lifetime value and insights  

Each level builds on the previous one — similar to how analysts iterate in a real job.

### ⚡ Challenges Faced
- Cleaning inconsistent dates and coupon codes  
- Joining multiple tables (sales, discount, tax, marketing)  
- Building correct cohort/retention logic  
- Translating SQL results into clear, impactful visuals  

I overcame these by writing modular SQL scripts and validating each step with sample outputs.

## 📑 Levels & Key Questions (Summary)
| Level | Focus Area | Sample Questions Solved |
|-------|------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | Basic KPIs | Total transactions, new customers per month |
| 2 | Coupons & Discounts | How many transactions used a coupon? Total discount per category |
| 3 | Sales Trends | Daily revenue trend, highest-sales weekday, top locations |
| 4 | Marketing | Revenue vs marketing spend by month, channel comparison |
| 5 | RFM Analysis | Recency, Frequency, Monetary per customer + Segmentation |
| 6 | Cross-Sell | Which products are frequently bought together |
| 7 | Cohort Analysis | Create cohorts, retention matrix, highest lifetime revenue |
| 8 | Economic Loss | Month with highest economic loss per year |
| 9 | Insights & Conclusion | Overall performance and recommendations |

## 📊 Insights
- **Revenue grew steadily** in Q3 with a peak on weekends  
- **Marketing spend** on online channels produced higher ROI than offline  
- **Premium customers (RFM)** generated 3x the revenue of Standard customers  
- **Cohort retention** improved after targeted discounts were introduced  
- **Cross-sell**: Products A and B are most frequently bought together  

## 📝 Conclusion
This project shows how raw transactional data can be turned into actionable business insights using SQL and Power BI.  
It also demonstrates a repeatable workflow for analyzing any retail/e-commerce dataset.
